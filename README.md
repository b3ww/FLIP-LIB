# Flip-Lib

Flip-Lib is a C++ library designed to facilitate network communication by providing serialization and deserialization functionalities for data transmission. It is particularly useful for building networked applications, such as client-server systems, where data needs to be exchanged between different components over the network.

## Features

- **Serialization and Deserialization**: Flip-Lib allows objects to be serialized into a stream of bytes for transmission over the network and deserialized back into objects at the receiving end.

- **Serializable Objects**: Objects that need to be transmitted over the network can inherit from the `Serializable` class provided by Flip-Lib. This enables easy integration with the library's serialization framework.

- **Typed Serialization**: Flip-Lib provides template classes like `TypedSerializable` for typed serialization of data, making it flexible and efficient.

- **Payload Handling**: The library includes classes like `Payload` to handle payload data in network requests. These classes can be easily serialized and deserialized for network communication.

## Usage

To use Flip-Lib in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Include Flip-Lib Headers**: Include the necessary Flip-Lib headers in your project.

2. **Serialize Objects**: Inherit from the `Serializable` class to make your objects serializable. Implement the `serialize` and `deserialize` methods to define how your objects are serialized and deserialized.

3. **Transmit Data**: Use Flip-Lib's serialization functions to serialize your data before transmitting it over the network. Similarly, deserialize received data using Flip-Lib's deserialization functions.

4. **Handle Payloads**: Use Flip-Lib's `Payload` class or similar classes to handle payload data in network requests. Serialize and deserialize payload objects as needed.

## Example

Here's a simple example demonstrating the usage of Flip-Lib:

```cpp
#include <flip/Serializable.hpp>
#include <flip/Payload.hpp>

using namespace flip;

class MyData : public Serializable {
public:
    // Implement serialize and deserialize methods
};

int main() {
    // Create a Payload object
    Payload payload("routeName", 200, serialStream("serializedData"));

    // Serialize the payload
    serialStream serializedPayload = payload.serialize();

    // Transmit the serialized payload over the network...

    return 0;
}
